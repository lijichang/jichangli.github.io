<h3>Short Bio</h3>
<p>I am a Ph.D candidate at the Department of Computer Science, the University of Hong Kong, supervised by <a href="https://i.cs.hku.hk/~yzyu/">Prof. Yizhou YU </a>(IEEE Fellow). I also work with <a href="http://guanbinli.com/"> Prof. Guanbin LI</a> from Sun Yat-sen University.I received my master's degree of engineering in Computer Science at South China University of Technology in 2020, advised by <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=uawKm4wAAAAJ&hl=en">Prof. Zhiwen YU</a> and <a href="https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=RtkXrnwAAAAJ&hl=en">Prof. Si WU</a></p> 

<p>My research interests are computer vision and deep Learning, mainly focusing on weakly supervised learning, such as semi-supervised learning, domain adaptation, learning with noisy labels, and so on.</p>
