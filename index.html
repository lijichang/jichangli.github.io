<h3>Short Bio</h3>
<p>I am a Ph.D student at the Department of Computer Science, the University of Hong Kong, supervised by <a href="https://i.cs.hku.hk/~yzyu/">Prof. Yizhou YU </a>(IEEE Fellow). I also work with <a href="http://guanbinli.com/"> Prof. Guanbin LI</a> from Sun Yat-sen University.</p> 

<p>My research interests are <b>Computer Vision</b> and <b>Deep Learning</b>, mainly focusing on weakly supervised learning such as <b>Semi-supervised Learning</b>, <b>Domain Adaptation</b> and <b>Learning from Noisy Labels</b>.</p>

<p>In 2020, I received my Master's Degree of Engineering in Computer Science at South China University of Technology, advised by <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=uawKm4wAAAAJ&hl=en">Prof. Zhiwen YU</a> and <a href="https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=RtkXrnwAAAAJ&hl=en">Prof. Si WU</a>.
